# Changelog

## 0.12.0

- The requirement list in the build panel now shows the total available before the amount needed (e.g. `Wood 64/2`). The total includes your inventory, nearby chests and ground items within range.

## 0.11.1

- Updated the BepInExPack_Valheim dependency to 5.4.2360.

## 0.11.0

- Added an `.editorconfig`, `Directory.Build.props` and a CI workflow that runs `dotnet format`, a Release build and a NuGet vulnerability check.
- Reformatted the code to match the new code style rules (no behaviour change).
- Moved the Harmony patches into the `NoHammerBuildMenu.Patches` namespace.
- Tidied up packaging scripts and workflow files.
- Added a `.gitattributes` to keep line endings consistent.
- Moved the local Valheim install paths into `Directory.Build.props`; set `VALHEIM_DIR` and `BEPINEX_PROFILE_DIR` once to build every mod without editing the `.csproj`.
- Updated README and icon.

## 0.10.1

- Increased the default radius for nearby ground items from 10m to 30m.

## 0.10.0

- The hammer now uses items on the ground within a configurable range.
- This can be adjusted by changing the `Radius` setting under the `Ground Items` section in the config file.
- The build grid lines at 2m intervals now use the configured `Line Width`, and the lines in between are thinner (`Minor Line Width Scale`, default 0.5, set to 1 for uniform lines), making 2m distances (the size of many pieces) easy to read at any grid size.

## 0.9.0

- The build grid now draws a distinct line through the centre of each world chunk, making it easy to find a chunk's centre. Its width and colour can be changed with the new `Chunk Centre Line Width` and `Chunk Centre Line Color` options in the `Grid Appearance` config section.
- Moved the Harmony patches out of `Plugin.cs` into dedicated files (no behaviour change).
- Updated README.

## 0.8.1

- Increased the default radius for nearby chests from 20m to 30m.
- Updated README.

## 0.8.0

- Building now takes materials from nearby chests as well as your inventory. Your own stock is used first and only the shortfall comes from chests (nearest first), and a piece can only be built if your inventory and nearby chests combined have enough. The build panel shows the combined amount.
- Only player-built chests you could normally open are used (not other players' private chests, chests in use, or ones in a ward you can't access).
- Added a new `Chests` config section with `Use Nearby Chests` and `Radius` (default 20m).

## 0.7.0

- The mod's controls (repair toggle, build grid toggle, grid distance and camera zoom) now show in the build key hints at the bottom of the screen, like the vanilla ones. They only show while a hammer patched by the mod is equipped, and not when using a gamepad.

## 0.6.0

- The build grid now snaps and draws on whichever face of a piece you are looking at: the top (as before), the underside (e.g. ceilings), and vertical walls, so pieces can be aligned along all axes.
- Snapping only moves the aim point within the targeted surface, so pieces never snap to empty air. Diagonal walls only snap in height and show no grid.
- Terrain and non-piece objects keep snapping horizontally as before.

## 0.5.0

- Decreased the default brightness of the build grid lines.
- Made the build grid appearance configurable in the new `Grid Appearance` config section: radius, fade start, rebuild distance, lift, segment length, line widths, and line colours.

## 0.4.0

- Highlight world chunk borders in a different colour.
- Make the build grid thicker and more visible.
- Shift+right-click (repair toggle) and Ctrl+right-click (grid toggle) no longer also open the build menu when using the vanilla hammer or other hammers, not just the phantom hammer.

## 0.3.0

- Hold Alt and scroll to zoom the camera in and out while a hammer is equipped and placing a piece, so you no longer need to unequip the hammer to get a closer look. Alt+scroll does not rotate the piece.

## 0.2.0

- Added a world build grid: a visible grid overlay near your aim point (following the terrain, or flat on top of player-built floors) with snap points at every vertex. Pieces snap to grid vertices like they do to other pieces' snap points, and snapping to other pieces still takes priority.
- Hold Ctrl and scroll to double or halve the grid distance (0.25m, 0.5m, 1m, 2m, 4m; 0.5m default).
- The grid only applies while a hammer is equipped (the phantom hammer, the vanilla hammer, or modded hammers with "hammer" in their name), not the hoe or cultivator.
- Whatever the game uses as the piece's anchor at the aim point (the selected snap point, or in `Auto` the part of the piece closest to the surface you are aiming at) is the part placed on the grid vertex.
- Press Ctrl + Right Mouse Button while building to toggle the grid. Enabled state and distance are in the `Grid` config section.

## 0.1.5

- Added repair mode toggle keybind (Shift + Right Mouse Button) to switch between repair mode and the last selected build piece.

## 0.1.4

- Ensure hammer recipes are known without needing to hold a physical hammer

## 0.1.3

- Fix website link in manifest file
- Include CHANGELOG.md in the packaged mod files

## 0.1.2

- Made hammer invincible so it does not break
- The hammer is no longer invisible when equipped in the player's hand

## 0.1.1

- Fixed README with example screenshot

## 0.1.0

- Initial release
- Configurable keybind (default `B`) opens the build menu without a hammer in your inventory, and shows the hammer in-hand
- Keybind is rebindable from your mod manager
